# py-chess-tree-two-week-challenge

In January 2016, in order to learn python, a new language for me, I set for myself the goal of creating a substantial application in two weeks. This is the result. 

The application I selected was an opening repertoire editor for chess because there was no existing program that let me edit chess openings the way I wanted to, by viewing and editing the repertoire's tree structure. 

More recently, I've put more work into this project, both in python and React.js. You can find that work here [https://github.com/colindavey/py-chess-tree]

The code here is to preserve the state that it was in at the end of the two-week challenge.

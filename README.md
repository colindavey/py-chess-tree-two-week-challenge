# py-chess-tree-two-week-challenge

In January 2016, in order to learn python, a new language for me, I set for myself the goal of creating a substantial application in two weeks. This is the result. 

The application I selected was an opening repertoire editor for chess because there was no existing program that let me edit chess openings the way I wanted to, by viewing and editing the repertoire's tree structure. 

More recently, I've put more work into this project, both in python and React.js. 

The code here is to preserve the state that it was in at the end of the two-week challenge.
